## Introduction
The rise in population across the globe has created a lot of opportunities in the transportation sector. Electric Vehicle (EV) is the sustainable solution to mitigate the emission of green house gases from the internal combustion engine vehicles. Thus, Fast Charging Stations (FCS) are gaining a lot of importance from the EV sector. The battery inside the EV gets refulled at the FCS in a quicker pace. However, the EV has to wait in queue before getting into the service as the charging time of the battery is not in fraction of seconds. Thus, the FCS has to plan its service so as to minimize the waiting time of the EV user in the station. This guarantees the quality of service to the EV users. The number of charging piles determines the level of service for a FCS. Aspiration level model is one of the decision making model which is used to find the optimum number of charging piles by limiting the time spent by EV in FCS and percentage idleness of charging piles in FCS. Minimizing the time spent by EV in FCS maximizes the customer's satisfaction and minimizing the percenatge idlness of charging piles shows faith in money utilized in purchasing the charging piles. Aspiration level model is used in preplan the Fast Charging Stations in EV developing countries like India, as it has less dependency on the data.

## Costs and Features
## Defining the system
The parameters of the aspiration level model depends upon the average arrival rate of EVs at the FCS, average charging rate and the system capacity of the FCS. The system capacity of the FCS can be either finite or infinite. According to the system data given, the average time spent by the EV in FCS and percentage idlness of the charging piles are calculated and based on the thresholds for the same given, the aspiration level model gives out the optimal number of charging piles for the FCS which helps in providing good quality of service to the EV users.
